# robustness-testing

This is a repo that contains a variety of robustness tests for trading systems.

## How to use

Head over to the [Robustness Testing.ipynb](notebooks/Robustness Testing.ipynb) notebook for a step-by-step guide on how to use the framework.

## Next Steps

- Add more tests
- Productionize the robustness testing framework in a form of a package, allowing for easy integration with the [AlphaGen framework](https://github.com/chickenopoulos/alphagen) and in general, ease-of-use for the user. The outcome should be as simple as importing the package and calling a function to run a test on a given strategy.
